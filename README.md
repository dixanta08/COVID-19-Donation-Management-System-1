# Introduction

The coronavirus disease has caused very serious injuries all around the world in the past few 
years, many countries have performed different kind of action to stop it. To stop the disease from 
spreading out, medical supplies such as face masks and hand sanitizers are especially important. 
Luckily, there are many countries helping one another by donating huge number of medical supplies. 

 Malaysia is one of country that having a lot of detected cases, and worse the number of 
detected cases is increasing dramatically. The government is continuously seeking fundraising and 
donation to overcome the shortage of medical supplies. Lately, one of the non-profit organizations 
(NGO) of Malaysia, Malaysia Red Crescent Society has received several types of medical supplies. 
So, COVID-19 Donation Management System has been designed in C Programming Language to 
systematically organize the supplies. 

 This system has four main functions which are create inventory, update donation quantities, 
search donation and list donation. Inventory creation function allows user to add new donation into 
system; update donation quantities function allows users to update the quantity of donation that 
already exists in system in either received or distributed condition; search donation function allows 
user to search check all information of a donation record such as supply code, available quantity, 
number of shipments by giving proper donation code; list donation function produce a list of all 
donations and their distributed quantities for user. 

The system uses text files as data storage and has different format to store information for 
donation and distribution. Control structures, functions, array, pointers, structures, files and many 
more programming skills are implemented in the system to make the whole program run smoothly.
Program design such as pseudocode and flowchart have been made before actual starting to develop 
the system to make coding smoother. Validation of inputs and tidiness of code are both prioritized 
while developing the system.
